# RayTracker Overview
Raytracker is a visualization tool which helps explain the basics of raytracing. Ray tracing is a common computer graphics rendering technique which is capable of creating very realistic images. Ray tracers are slow, and analyzing bottlenecks can be tough, so I made this tool to try to alleviate part of the problem. 

Code for the ray tracer and generating image data can be found in the C++ folder in the code folder. The main page uses a combination of flexbox, which is built into CSS, and d3 V4.
